# Manage Skills

## When to Use
When a user wants to find skills, install them, create new ones, or understand the skills system.

## Verify Installation

After installing a skill, confirm it's available:

```bash
gapman skills list -d ./my-agent | grep "code-review"
```

## Search Skills

```bash
# Search SkillsMP registry
gapman skills search "code review"

# Search GitHub
gapman skills search "pdf reader" --provider github

# Limit results
gapman skills search "testing" --limit 5
```

## Install Skills

```bash
# Install from SkillsMP to agent-local skills/
gapman skills install code-review -d ./my-agent

# Install globally to ~/.agents/skills/
gapman skills install code-review --global

# Install from GitHub
gapman skills install owner/repo#skills/my-skill --provider github
```

## List Skills

```bash
# Show all discovered skills (local + global)
gapman skills list -d ./my-agent

# Only agent-local skills
gapman skills list -d ./my-agent --local
```

## Inspect a Skill

```bash
gapman skills info code-review -d ./my-agent
```

Shows: name, description, license, allowed tools, metadata, optional directories.

## Create a Skill

1. Create directory: `skills/<name>/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does (max 1024 chars)
license: MIT
allowed-tools: Read Edit Grep Glob Bash
metadata:
  author: your-name
  version: "1.0.0"
  category: developer-tools
---

# Instructions

[Detailed instructions for using this skill.
Keep under ~5000 tokens / ~20000 characters.]
```

3. Reference it in `agent.yaml`:
```yaml
skills:
  - my-skill
```

4. Validate:
```bash
gapman validate -d ./my-agent
```

## Skill Discovery Paths

Skills are found in this order (first match wins):

| Priority | Path |
|----------|------|
| 1 | `<agent>/skills/` |
| 2 | `<agent>/.agents/skills/` |
| 3 | `<agent>/.claude/skills/` |
| 4 | `<agent>/.github/skills/` |
| 5 | `~/.agents/skills/` |

## Optional Directories in Skills

- `scripts/` — Executable scripts the skill can reference
- `references/` — Reference documents
- `assets/` — Images, static files
- `agents/` — Skill-specific sub-agents
